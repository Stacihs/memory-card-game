#Memory Game
This is a project required for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. We were given the task of creating an in browser matching card game. We were provided with html and css starter code.  The javascript starter code only included the shuffle function.  We had to build out the rest of the javascript code on our own.
