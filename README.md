# Memory Game
This is a project required for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. We were given the task of creating an in browser matching card game. We were provided with HTML and CSS starter code.  The javascript starter code only included the shuffle function.  We had to build out the rest of the JavaScript code on our own.

## How to Play

#### Game Access

You can access this game by going to https://stacihs.github.io/memory-card-game/. The recommended browser for play is Google Chrome.

#### Rules of Play

The goal of this game is to match eight pairs of cards. The player clicks on two cards at a time. When a match is found, the pair of cards stay flipped until all the cards are displayed. The player has then won the game, as indicated by a pop up window. The pop up contains the duration of the game and quality of play. The player is also asked if they would like to play another game. If, at any time during play, the player would like to start over, a restart button has been provided.

## Resources

The font type comes from Google Fonts and the icons originate from the Bootstrap CDN for Font Awesome. CSS is provided with separate styling sheets, including a responsive styling sheet with media queries.
