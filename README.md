# Memory Game
This is a project required for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. We were given the task of creating an in browser matching card game. We were provided with html and css starter code.  The javascript starter code only included the shuffle function.  We had to build out the rest of the javascript code on our own. Media queries have been utilized to add responsiveness.

In this game, the player tries to match pairs of cards. When a match is found, the pair of cards stay flipped until all the cards are flipped over. The player has then won the game, as indicated by a pop up window. The pop up contains the duration of the game and quality of play. The player is also asked if they would like to play another game. If, at any time during play, the player would like to start over, a restart button has been provided.
